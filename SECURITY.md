Joyspot Security Reporting Policy

## Introduction
At Joyspot, we take the security of our platform seriously and are committed to ensuring the privacy and safety of our users. We encourage responsible reporting of vulnerabilities that may be found within our systems. This Security Reporting Policy outlines the process for reporting vulnerabilities, the levels of severity, and guidelines for ensuring responsible disclosure.

## Levels of Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities are categorized into four levels of severity:

a) Critical: Vulnerabilities that are severe security flaws that, if exploited, can lead to unauthorized access, loss of sensitive data, or system compromise, causing significant harm to the affected organization and its users.
b) High: Vulnerabilities that can lead to unauthorized access, exposure of sensitive user data, or can significantly impact the availability of our platform.
c) Medium: Vulnerabilities that can lead to limited unauthorized access or exposure of non-sensitive data.
d) Low: Vulnerabilities with minimal impact on the platform, such as user interface issues, or those that do not pose a significant risk to users.

## Reporting Guidelines
When reporting a vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

a) Make it private: Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability or share any sensitive information about it with others. Instead, send your report to our security team via our dedicated email address: security@joyspot.com.

b) Software details: Clearly specify the software, version, and configuration where the vulnerability is present. If possible, provide a URL or a screenshot that demonstrates the issue.

c) Steps to replicate: Provide a detailed and clear description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability. This will enable our security team to quickly and accurately assess the issue.

d) Vulnerability type: Specify the type of vulnerability (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, etc.), and provide any relevant technical details that will help us understand the nature of the issue.

## Responsible Disclosure
We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the vulnerability before publicly disclosing any information about it. We are committed to acknowledging receipt of your report within 48 hours and will work closely with you to understand and resolve the issue.

## Recognition
We appreciate your efforts in helping us maintain the security of our platform. While we do not currently offer a monetary reward for reporting vulnerabilities, we will publicly acknowledge your contribution in our security updates and hall of fame (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Policy Updates
We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time without prior notice. Any changes will be posted on our website and will become effective upon posting.

By following this Security Reporting Policy, you help us maintain the safety and privacy of our users and the integrity of our platform. We look forward to working with you to ensure a secure experience for everyone on Joyspot.
